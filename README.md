Meteor Envy
===========

### Problem
I use Meteor for small projects that apply Continuous Integration. I tend to have to switch a lot between my the development version and the production version of my app, and I usually have both of them running in a browser somewhere simultaneously. Because of the constant updates they are very similar, and it confuses the crap out of me. **Enough!**

### Solution
Envy! My poor development environment suffering ruthless boundary testing and endless tinkering will now expose its discontent by seeing red with envy. Finally something obvious to show me which version is dev and which is prod!

### Future
In the near future I will set up a staging environment. 2.0 will have a color for that.
